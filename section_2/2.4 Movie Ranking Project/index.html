<h1>The Best Movies According to Sumit K</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite movies which I can watch anytime and won't be bored. This
  movie beautifully captures the struggles in life and how one should be
  persistent to make his situation better. The acting feels very natural and all
  in all it is a very good package.

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
  A must watch for students I would say. The movie is filled with laughs and
  lessons. For all parents who are running after the grades of there children
  should watch it at least once.
</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
  Viewers who like gaming should watch it to experience what can be the future
  of VR gaming. As per personal recommendations I would have liked if there were
  easter eggs of real life famous games.
